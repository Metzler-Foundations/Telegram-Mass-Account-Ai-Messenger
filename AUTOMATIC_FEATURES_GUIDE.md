## 💾 WHERE IS THE DATA?

All intelligence is automatically saved to:

- `intelligence.db` - User values, patterns, scores
- `engagement.db` - Auto-reactions, tracking
- `status_intelligence.db` - Online patterns, timing
- `network.db` - Social graphs, relationships
- `shadowban_monitor.db` - Delivery tracking

**You never need to open these - they work automatically.**

---

## 🎮 VIEWING THE INTELLIGENCE (OPTIONAL)

If you want to see what's being collected, you can run:

```python
from advanced_features_manager import get_features_manager

features = get_features_manager()

# See overall stats
stats = features.get_overall_stats()
print(stats)

# Get high-value users
top_users = features.get_high_value_targets(min_score=70, limit=10)
for user in top_users:
    print(f"User {user.user_id}: {user.value_score} points - {user.value_tier.value}")
```

**But you don't have to - it's all working automatically!**
